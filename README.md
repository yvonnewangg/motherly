I developed a Postpartum Care App to help mothers monitor their postpartum health. The app calculates a personalized risk score for developing postpartum depression. 

### How to run it on your own machine

1. Install the requirements

   ```
   $ pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app

   ```
   $ streamlit run main.py
   ```
