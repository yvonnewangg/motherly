    ### Understanding Your Risk Scores

    - **EPDS Score**: This score is derived from the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, which assesses the risk of postpartum depression.
        - **0-9**: Low risk for postpartum depression
        - **10-12**: Possible risk; consider discussing this with your healthcare provider
        - **13 or higher**: High risk; strong recommendation to contact your healthcare provider for further evaluation

    - **Personalized Risk Score**: Your total risk score combines your EPDS score and your daily logged answers, providing a comprehensive view of your well-being. The maximum possible score is **40**. 

        - **0-10**: Low overall risk; generally managing well
        - **11-20**: Moderate risk; some areas may need attention
        - **21-30**: High risk; consider reaching out for additional support
        - **31-40**: Very high risk; immediate professional assistance is advised

    This personalized score helps you and your healthcare provider identify areas where you may need extra support and track your mental health over time.
